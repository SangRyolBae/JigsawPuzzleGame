### Jigsaw Puzzle Game

This project contains source code for the app
[Victoria's Jigsaw Puzzle for Toddlers and Kids](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/victorias-jigsaw-puzzle-for-toddlers-and-kids/9nblggh4w4qn)
published on the Microsoft Store. It is a jigsaw puzzle game with custom image selection.
It has a pretty unique feature (as for Windows Store apps)
to choose your own faviourite images, photos, pictures or screenshots for the puzzle
to have unforgettable experience :)

It is developed for the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) with no extra dependencies.

I developed the app originally for kids, however this can be interesting for people of all ages.
You can find a few screenshots on the Store.

### Inspiration

The development was inspired by two open source projects:
[WPF Jigsaw Puzzle](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/117037/WPF-Jigsaw-Puzzle)
(WPF) licensed under [CPOL 1.0.2](http://www.codeproject.com/info/cpol10.aspx)
and [C# Jigsaw Puzzle Game](http://freesourcecode.net/csharpprojects/40595/C%23-Jigsaw-Puzzle-Game-in-csharp#.Vzh1uGzQCwV)
(Windows Forms), no license identified.

Puzzle Game is an improvement over these projects towards Universal Windows Platform (UWP).
It has its own user interface for simpler usability.
